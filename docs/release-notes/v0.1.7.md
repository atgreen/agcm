# v0.1.7

Bug fix release addressing export issues, search navigation, and file picker styling.

## Bug Fixes

- **Export fixes**:
  - Combined exports (`--combined`) now properly add cases to the manifest
  - Filter metadata is now correctly persisted in the export manifest
  - Attachments are now downloaded in combined export mode
  - Progress counter uses atomic operations for accurate counts

- **Search navigation**: Fixed `Ctrl-f` search scrolling to wrong positions
  - Now tracks actual viewport line offsets instead of synthetic line numbers
  - Correctly handles headers, metadata, and separator lines in position calculations

- **API client cleanup**: Added `Close()` method to properly release resources
  - Debug file descriptor is now closed on application exit

## Improvements

- **File picker styling**: Redesigned for better readability
  - Dark background with proper contrast
  - Right-aligned file sizes for consistent alignment
  - Full-width highlight on selected row
  - Styled text input for path entry

- **Debug mode**: Debug files are now only created when `--debug` flag is used
  - Removed unconditional debug file creation in TUI components
