# v0.1.1

Bug fix release addressing search API changes and usability improvements.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed KCS search**: Updated search API to use new Red Hat endpoint (`POST /support/search/v2/kcs`) after the old endpoint was decommissioned
- **Search now includes cases**: The `agcm search` command now searches both cases and KCS (solutions/articles), matching the documented behavior
- **Fixed mouse click alignment**: Fixed case list mouse click selection being offset when filter bar is displayed
- **Fixed scrollbar drag**: Scrollbar drag now works correctly with lazy-loaded case lists
- **Fixed update command auth**: Self-update no longer requires GitHub authentication for public repo

## Improvements

- **Export debug logging**: Added `--debug` flag support for export commands to help diagnose issues
- **Status aliases for export**: Added `open` and `closed` as convenient aliases for status filters:
  - `--status open` expands to "Waiting on Red Hat,Waiting on Customer"
  - `--status closed` expands to "Closed"

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Search across cases, solutions, and articles
agcm search "kernel panic"

# Export open cases with debug output
agcm export cases --account 12345 --status open --debug
```
