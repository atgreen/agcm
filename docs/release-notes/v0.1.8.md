# v0.1.8

Feature release adding preset support to CLI commands.

## New Features

- **Preset support in CLI**: Use saved filter presets from the command line
  - `agcm list cases 1` - List cases using preset 1
  - `agcm export cases 1` - Export cases using preset 1
  - Presets are created in the TUI using `Ctrl+s` followed by a digit (0-9)
  - CLI flags can override preset values: `agcm list cases 1 --severity 1,2`

## Changes

- **Export cases requires filters**: `agcm export cases` without any filters or
  preset now displays usage help instead of exporting all cases
- **Help screen dismissal**: Any key now closes the help screen (previously
  only `?` worked)

## Behavior Notes

- If a preset slot has no saved filter, the command prints a message and exits
- CLI flags always override preset values when both are provided
- `agcm list cases` without arguments still lists all cases (unchanged)
