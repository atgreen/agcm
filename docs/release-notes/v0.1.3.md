# v0.1.3

Bug fix release addressing several issues found during code review.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed 401 retry with POST/PUT requests**: Token refresh retries now correctly resend the request body instead of an empty body
- **Fixed case list rendering**: Strip non-printable Unicode characters from case summaries that were causing display corruption
- **Fixed Hydra query filters**: Implemented missing filters (GroupNumber, OwnerSSOName, StartDate, EndDate) and added default exclusion of closed cases
- **Fixed update command auth**: `agcm update` no longer requires authentication
- **Fixed accounts pagination**: `agcm list accounts` now iterates through all cases instead of just the first page
- **Fixed export deadlock**: Prevent deadlock when `--concurrency 0` is specified

## New Features

- **Ctrl+F text search in case detail**: Search within case content with Ctrl+N/P to navigate between matches
- **Mouse scroll during search**: Scrollbars remain functional while text search is open

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Search within a case (in TUI, focus detail pane then press Ctrl+F)
# Navigate matches with Ctrl+N (next) and Ctrl+P (previous)

# Export cases with date range
agcm export cases --since 2024-01-01 --until 2024-12-31

# List all accounts (now paginates through all cases)
agcm list accounts
```
